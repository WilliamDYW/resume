      - title: Tomasulo Out-of-Order CPU
        location: 06/2023-08/2023
        description: 
          - Designed CPU with Out-of-Order Execution and In-order Commitment.
          - Implemented Branch Prediction Buffer(BPB) and Return Stack Address(RAS) for speculative execution beyond branches.
          - Implemented BRAM-based Copy Free Check-pointing(CFC) with RRAT for recovery from path misprediction.
          - Implemented Store Buffer(SB), Store Address Buffer(SAB), Reorder Buffer(ROB), 2-stage Dispatch Unit, Free Register List(FRL) and Issue Unit(IU).

      - title: 512-bit 6T SRAM Array Design
        location: 01/2023-05/2023
        description: 
          - Designed and drew layout of 1-bit SRAM cell, row/column decoder, sense amplifier, write driver, precharge circuit, latch and flip-flop with Cadence Virtuoso and GPDK 45nm.
          - Achieved the Read SNM of 210 mV and Write SNM of 395 mV by proper sizing with VDD=1V while minimizing the size of 1-bit SRAM cell.
          - Integrated components into 4 8x16-bit SRAM banks to construct a 512-bit SRAM Array with the area of 2208 $nm^2$ in 2.6 Ghz (cycle time=0.4 ns).
          - Measured the power consumption with Spectre, in which the average consumption for reading is 21.2 fJ, the average consumption for writing is 342 fJ and leakage is around 20 fJ.
          - Validated the correctness of all aforementioned components with vector file in Spectre and cleared DRC and LVS errors.
      - title: Extensible Asynchronous SNN Accerlator
        location: 01/2023-05/2023
        description: 
          - Designed extensible asynchronous SNN accelerator in SystemVerilog with SystemVerilogCSP library on a 5x5 filter and 25x25 ifmap with stride=1.
          - Implemented fork-join computation module that can calculate part of the overall computation with pre-configured parameter for extensibility.
          - Integrated computation modules with two memory modules, which contain filter map and ifmap respectively, on a mesh network.
          - Verified correctness of computation module and the accelerator separately with timestep=2 in QuestaSim.
      - show: false
        title: 5-stage Pipeline MIPS Processor
        location: 09/2022-10/2022
        description: 
          - Described Data Path Unit and Control Unit for single-cycle CPU with basic MIPS instructions.
          - Resolved problems related to Data Dependency and Early Branching.
          - Utilized Verilog to build 5-stage pipeline with encoded control signal, Internal Forwarding Register File and Early Branching.
